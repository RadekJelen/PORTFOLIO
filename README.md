## <a name="aboutme">ABOUT ME</a>

 ### <p align="center"><b>Why did I decide to become a software tester?</b></p>
<p align="justify">I am the person in the team who can look critically and at the same time delicately give comments without hurting anyone. In my work I always take care of high quality and every detail of the tasks performed. I can find mistakes, but I also appreciate constructive criticism, because it allows me to self-develop. The constant desire for self-development is another advantage of being a tester which convinced me to choose this career path. During the training process, I mastered the skills of exploratory testing, website testing and REST API testing, writing test cases, reporting defects and creating test reports. I know how to use Chrome DevTools, Jira, Postman, GIT and GitHub. The effects can be seen in this repository. My curiosity grows with each new skill and knowledge, I'm convinced that I want to go deeper into the world of testing. I am ready to take on new challenges as a member of the development team.</p>
