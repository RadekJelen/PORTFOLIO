# PORTFOLIO

## About me
My name is Radosław Jeleń. I have recently embarked on a career change journey in order to become a Software Tester. This career path has interested me for quite a while, so I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills. I believe that high quality is the bestselling point of services and products. Thanks to my diversified experience I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy, which help me see the bigger picture and function well within a team. In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. This is why I am now looking for a junior position in testing.

**My experience**

My previous experience is mainly related to cooking and catering. I have worked as a shift cook, breakfast cook and even as a sous chef. I've also completed such majors as dietetics and demand. I really enjoy learning new interesting things. I am very interested in programming and software testing. I think this is what I would like to do in life. In this repository there are numerous projects that I have managed to create in the course and as a hobby. I also try to keep abreast of industry news, as well as participate in various classes that will allow me to better develop in this field.
